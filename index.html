  <p>Data Science Africa with financial support from Facebook is announcing a call to support research addressing local challenges in Africa. We aim to support up to ten pilot and early stage research projects that leverage data science, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods to develop tools with broad societal benefits. Up to four projects responding to the immediate crises facing Africa due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the locust invasion in East Africa will be selected for expedited support. The aim of this RFP is to provide access to resources currently limiting research productivity in Africa with a focus on data science research.
