  <p>Data Science Africa announced a call to support research addressing local challenges in Africa in August 2020. The aim was to support up to ten pilot and early stage research projects that leverage data science, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) methods to develop tools with broad societal benefits. We are happy to announce the projects selected.

  <h3>About DSA</h3>
  <p> DSA is registered as an NGO in Kenya. Since 2015, DSA has held an annual summer school and workshop to train participants on machine learning and data science methods and provide an avenue for researchers to present work demonstrating the application of these techniques to problems relevant in the African context.

  <p>Starting in 2018 with DSA Nyeri (East Africa) and DSA Abuja (West Africa), we now hold two events annually with one in East Africa and the other in West Africa. This is in line with our goal to consolidate the regional community in East Africa while also expanding to other regions. Our West African events are also aimed at creating a strong community of researchers in the region working across the linguistic boundaries between French and English speaking nations.
